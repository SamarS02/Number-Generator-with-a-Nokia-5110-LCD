# Number-Generator-with-a-Nokia-5110-LCD
This is a file created in C where a Nokia 5110 LCD is attached to the GPIO pins on the MSP 432 microcontroller.
The LCD then displays a number, takes the remainder of that number depending on how many digits it had, adding a specific amount to that number, and displaying it again.
The number can go all the way up to a 16-bit integer.
